# Heart Disease Prediction App
This is an interactive machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on key medical parameters. The app utilizes machine learning models to make real-time predictions and provides an intuitive interface built with Streamlit.

The project integrates concepts from machine learning, data science, and web development to provide an effective and user-friendly tool for heart disease prediction.

## Features
### Real-Time Predictions:
The app predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical input data, allowing users to get quick results.
### User-Friendly Interface: 
Built with Streamlit, the app has a simple and intuitive design, making it easy for users to interact with.
### Machine Learning Model:
The prediction model is trained on relevant medical datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.
### Input Parameters:
Users can input key medical data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., for heart disease prediction.

## Tools & Technologies
### Python:
Core language used for data processing and machine learning.
### Streamlit:
A framework for building the interactive web application interface.
### Scikit-Learn: 
Library used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
### Pandas:
For data manipulation and analysis.
### NumPy:
